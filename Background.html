                        <p>I am Jaden A. Luce, a dedicated and ambitious student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Pre-Finance with a Minor in Spanish at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Business. With a passion for finance and a keen interest in the Spanish language, I have maintained an impressive GPA of 3.90 overall and a perfect 4.0 in my major. As the recipient of the Brigham Young Grant, I have actively engaged in the university's Finance Society and Beta Alpha Psi, where I've gained valuable insights into the world of investment banking and financial leadership.</p>
                        <p>In my professional journey, I have had the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to esteemed organizations. As an Investment Banking Intern at Concordia Capital, I honed my analytical skills by focusing on growth equity investments for B2B software service companies. Additionally, my role as a Financial Analyst Intern at Prestige Financial Services allowed me to collaborate with executives on complex matters such as bond securitizations and investment structures. I believe in the power of teamwork, exemplified during my tenure as an Installation Technician at Audio Visual Systems, where I worked alongside a new crew to successfully complete high-stakes projects.</p>
                        <p>Beyond academics and professional endeavors, my commitment to service has been a cornerstone of my personal growth. Serving as a Volunteer Representative for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints on the Texas-Mexico Border, I not only developed leadership skills overseeing a large team but also spearheaded collaborative efforts with local charities to aid refugees. My diverse experiences, coupled with fluency in both Spanish and English, proficiency in computer languages like SQL and VBA, and a range of interests from sports to outdoor activities, shape me into a well-rounded individual ready to embrace new challenges and opportunities.</p>
